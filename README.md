# Uncovering ECG Changes during Healthy Aging using Explainable AI

This is the official repository for the paper [Uncovering ECG Changes during Healthy Aging using Explainable AI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107115). The research uncovers healthy age-related ECG changes by analyzing ECG data from diverse age groups using diverse models such as deep learning and tree-based classifiers, as well as model explainability.
